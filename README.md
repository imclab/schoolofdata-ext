ScodaQuiz
=========

A Quiz generating Javascript framework for [School of
Data](http://schoolofdata.org)

If you're changing any javascript - be sure to run the makefile in the js
directory (requires the closure-compiler)

The quiz uses Jquerys $.post to post to a google form - in detail it
re-implements the post-request sent by a standard google form: create a
form and check what the post-request looks like: post and make sure to
include all the data that is in the original post request...
