# Scoda-Ext

Extensions for the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org)

## Introduction

At the School of Data we need quite some extra things: Quizzes that are
able to issue badges once completed, feedbackforms that do the same etc. 

This repository contains a giant django project (together with some
applications) to do exactly this.

## Contributing

There are several things you can do to help us grow this project

* Test and submit issues for bugs you find/features you wish it'd have
* Help us out and create nice style sheets for the quizzes and feedback
  forms.
* Bring your Python and [Django](http://djangoproject.org) out and help
  building the plattform.
* Think of more Quizzes for courses on the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/courses)
