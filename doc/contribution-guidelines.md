# Contribution Guidelines

These guidlines are *not* set in stone and comments/alterations are welcome. While you should try to stick to them - they are not absolute and binding. The main aim is to make contributing easier for everyone.

## Code

### Python/Django

* Try to stick to [pep8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Create new functionality in a new app (below scodaext.apps)

### Templates

* Keep templates with the app in templates/<app>/ 

### Static Files

* Keep static files in the static/ subdirectory of your app.
